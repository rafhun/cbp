    After the installation of the module you will find a default content page with the section "filesharing".<br /><br />

    You can use the default page as a sample for new pages. If you create a new page with a custom cmd, the filesharing module creates a correspondent directory and moves the uploaded files into the folder.<br />
    If you specify the cmd "downloads", the uploaded files are going to be moved to the Digital Asset Management module\'s images directory.
